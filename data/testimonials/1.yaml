text: "Installation crew was knowledgeable and friendly and the work was done in a timely manner. I choose a Briggs and Stratton over a Generac standby generator because of the better efficiency at full load that didn't require a gas meter upgrade. The only negative was the cabinet was not set as level as I expected."
